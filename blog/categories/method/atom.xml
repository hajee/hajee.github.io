    <content type="html"><![CDATA[In this blog post,  I will look into Puppet and describe the building blocks Puppet uses.

In Puppet, you describe how your system should be configured by describing the artefacts available on the system. Per artefact, you describe it's detailed configuration. A configured system contains many artefacts. How can we structure these artefacts in such a way that it is readable, understandable and maybe usable by other (parts of) the organisation.

##The resource type
Generally a system consists of files, services, processes, packages and so on and so on. In the Puppet world, these are called resources. Resources are of a specified type. Lets say, for example, we want to make sure a configuration file is available on a unix system.  Besides being available, it should also contain the right content. With Puppet, we can do this by using the `File` type.

```ruby

file {'/application/config.xml':
  ensure	=> present,
  content	=> '<xml>just some config file</xml>',
}
```

besides the `File` type, there are types for managing `Users`, `Groups`, `Services` and so on. Actually Puppet has a lot of built-in types. If you look at [type documentation](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html) on the puppet site,you see a list of 48 built-in types.

<img src="/images/list_of_types.png" title="List of built-in types" >

A resource type is the smallest building block available in Puppet. Besides to the built-in types, Puppet has some other mechanism's to define structured sets of resources on a system. These are the `class` and the `defined resource`.

A resource type is the smallest building block available in Puppet. Besides to the built-in types, Puppet has some other mechanism's to define structured sets of resources on a system. These are the `class` and the `defined resource`. 


##The class
[The Puppet documentation for classes](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/2.7/reference/lang_classes.html) states:

<blockquote><p>Classes are named blocks of Puppet code which are not applied unless they are invoked by name. They can be stored in<br/>modules for later use and then declared (added to a node's catalog) with the include function or a resource-like syntax.</p></blockquote>

Quite some definition. In layman's terms, though a Puppet class is a way of structuring resources into a building block. The class [apache](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs/apache), for example, contains all resources needed to install, configure and run an apache https daemon on your system.


##The defined resource
[The Puppet documentation for defined types](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/2.7/reference/lang_defined_types.html) states:

<blockquote><p>Defined resource types (also called defined types or defines) are blocks of Puppet code that can be evaluated multiple<br/>times with different parameters. Once defined, they act like a new resource type: you can cause the block to be evaluated<br/>by declaring a resource of that new type.</p><p>Defines can be used as simple macros or as a lightweight way to develop fairly sophisticated resource types.</p></blockquote>

As you can see in the definition, just like the `class`, the defined resource is a block of Puppet code. So they are both a means to structure your Puppet code and make building blocks of reusable resources. The difference between a `class`and a  defined type is that a `class`may only be applied to your system. A defined type however, is some sort of template that can be applied multiple times to your system.


##The custom type
While the `class` and the defined type can and are used to describe small configurable elements on a system, the custom type is designed to do just that. Puppetlabs new that they would never be able to build all the `types` needed to describe all systems. So instead they made sure, Puppet is extensible by making your own types. In fact, all built-in types are build using the same extension mechanism that is available for custom types.


##Next time
This concludes our small introduction into the Puppet building blocks. Next time I will dive into building your own custom resources.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[In [my last blog post](/2013/10/02/visualize-your-continuous-deployment-maturity/), I described the main area's of interest to work on to get faster and easier deployments. For every area,  the level of maturity may be different. In this blog post,  I will dive deeper in the levels of maturity and what they mean.

Like I told in the previous blog posts, this information is based on the book ["Continuous Delivery"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321601912?ie=UTF8&tag=martinfowlerc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321601912) by [Jez Humble](http://jezhumble.net/) and [David Farley](http://www.davefarley.net/)

#The Five maturity levels

In the model, they describe the following five levels.

0. Regressive
1. Repeatable
2. Consistent
3. Quantitatively managed
4. Optimizing

<img src="/images/maturity-levels.png" title="The levels of maturity" >


### Regressive

There is no process for releasing and delivering software. A new deployment becomes an intensive event with a lot of opportunity to fail. A successful deployment is a victory. Although the number in the list says 1. In their book, Jez and David call the level -1. Minus because deployment is actually in the toddler stage.

###Repeatable
When you are at this levelÂ of maturity, some stuff is being take care of. Changes management processes are in lace. There are clear guidelines of what to do and when to do it. Most of the times the organisations have a OTAP strategy, but most of the testing is done by humans. Only a small part of the tests, if any, is automated. Not a lot has been done to automate deployment. Most of the work is done by typing commands on a terminal based on a script in a paper document. In my view,  this is the minimum level at which you can rightfully claim you are doing [ITIL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology_Infrastructure_Library#ITIL_V3). As you can see this is still much lower than the levels proposed in [the book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321601912?ie=UTF8&tag=martinfowlerc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321601912)

###Consistent
At this level of maturity,  you have a broad set of automated tests. The tests are  at a sufficient level to detected critical errors early end often. The deployment is getting more and more automated. Deploying a new version to an integrated testing environment becomes easy.

###quantitatively managed
The testing and deployment are fully automated, and there is a pipeline in place to do the testing and deployments in OTAP environments. Bad versions are caught in the deployment pipeline before they reach production. Because deployments are easy and the quality of releases increase, teams start to do more and smaller deployments. The statistics of builds and deployments are tracked, and acted upon.

###optimizing
At the final level, not only all processes and tools are in place, but the whole organisation around building, testing and deploying software is constantly improving. Teams regularly discuss the problems and fix them. Every deployment, whether it is in production or any test environment is a vehicle for improvement.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[In [my last blog post](/2013/10/02/visualize-your-continuous-deployment-maturity/), I showed a way to visualize the level of maturity for the six interest area's of continuous delivery. In this blog post,  I will dig deeper into what the areas of interest are.

<!-- more -->

##The area's of interest

###Build management and continuous integration
Build management are all processes and tools we need to ensure that ,at any point in time, we can build a specific version of our software. Besides being able to build it, we also need to ensure that is works. To do this, we need a set of (preferably automated) unit-tests. To be able, to quickly see the impact of source code changes, at least every night a build must be done.

###Environments and deployments
To be able to do continuous delivery, there must be a pipeline of systems for doing DTAP(Development Testing, Acceptance and Production) like tests. It is cheap (meaning automated) to get a new environment for testing. Systems provisioning and application deployments are all automated. Also, there needs to be a way to automatically roll back to a previous well known working system state.

###Release management and compliance

Besides all sorts of tooling stuff, processes must be in place. There must be a (strict) change management process including regulated approvals to go from state to state (e.g. from testing to acceptance and so on to production). These change management processes and approvals must be enforced.

###Testing

To be able to do continuous delivery, testing must be highly automated. You need at least automated unit-tests and a set of automated acceptance tests. It is preferable to have the acceptance test scenario's written by testers and business representatives in cooperation. Not only functional tests need te be automated, there needs to be some sort of mechanism te check non-functional requirements like, for example, response times

###Data management

While most automated installation scripts focus on provisioning the software. The data in the database is just as important. Therefore, you need to have automated the way you change your data model and also the configuration data inside the database.

###Configuration management

To be able to get built every version in time at any moment,  we need source code management tools like [git](http://git-scm.com/) or [subversion](Apache Subversion). All components needed to get the software working, must be under this regime of version control. This includes the libraries and all database changes.
